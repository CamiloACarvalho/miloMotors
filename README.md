# Milo Motors Car Shop ðŸš— ðŸ’° ðŸš™
This project is about a fictitious car shop that I imagined. I will try to create a back-end to relate cars, sellers, clients, sales, and other things that I deemed important. I created this repository with the objective to practice Sequelize and database relationships.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Used for building the user interface.
- **Sequelize**: For managing application state.
- **Nodemon**: For routing within the application.
- **MySQL**: For adding static typing to the project.
- **Express**: For UI components.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
